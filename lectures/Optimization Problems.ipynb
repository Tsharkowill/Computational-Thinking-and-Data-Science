    "### The Story of Dynamic Programming\n",
    "The evolution of dynamic programming in computer science and mathematics is closely tied to its inventor, Richard Bellman. This history not only offers insights into the development of a technique but also delves into the politics of academic research funding during Bellman's era.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Origins in Applied Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "Richard Bellman was associated with RAND Corporation in the 1950s. He aimed to optimize specific processes and sequential decision-making, which would ultimately culminate in an optimal solution. Such decision-making was crucial for multi-stage decisions, where every decision had potential implications for future choices and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Name 'Dynamic Programming'\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"dynamic programming\" was born out of strategy. Bellman intentionally chose a name that obfuscated the true essence of the technique. In his time, research funding was deeply influenced by political nuances, and titles that appeared too research-oriented risked losing funding. \"Dynamic\" and \"programming\" were terms held in high regard during the initial days of the Cold War. Bellman humorously remarked on the impossibility of using the term \"dynamic\" in a negative context. Thus, he adopted the term to ensure continued funding without attracting unnecessary attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Principle of Optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of dynamic programming lies the \"Principle of Optimality\". This principle posits that an optimal policy or sequence of decisions inherently possesses a characteristic: irrespective of the starting state and early decisions, the subsequent decisions must be optimal in relation to the state resulting from the preliminary decisions. In layman terms, for a solution to be the best, every step within that solution should be the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming has found its niche in diverse areas, spanning from operations research and economics to bioinformatics and computer science. The methodology is apt for problems that decompose into smaller subproblems, provided these subproblems aren't independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Legacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Richard Bellman's dynamic programming brainchild and the subsequent contributions of various researchers transformed the approach to many optimization problems. Dynamic programming principles paved the way for algorithms like the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest paths and solutions to problems like the Knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bellman's ingenious approach, encapsulated in the dynamic programming technique, stands as a testament to how apt naming, combined with the socio-political climate of an era, can influence the trajectory of research."

    "### Memoization\n",
    "Memoization is an optimization technique primarily used to speed up computer programs by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caching Results:** At its core, memoization involves storing the results of complex operations in a cache so that future requests can be served faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Programming:** It's commonly used in dynamic programming to avoid the re-computation of the same subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space-Time Tradeoff:** While memoization can significantly speed up calculations by avoiding redundant computations, it consumes more memory to store the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools & Libraries:** Many programming languages offer built-in utilities or libraries to assist with memoization. For example, Python provides the functools.lru_cache decorator for this purpose."
