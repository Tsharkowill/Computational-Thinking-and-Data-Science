# Computational-Thinking-and-Data-Science

This repository is for my notes on the lectures and assignments from MIT's 6.0002 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/

Most of the material in the lectures is directly from the course notes although I have supplemented it with some expanded explanations of concepts
